## About Me

Hi, I'm Ivor.  I'm a software developer and a recent graduate in Computer Engineering from uOttawa. 
 
I love programming, especially when the task at hand involves one or more of my favourite interests: IoT, robotics, smart cities, or machine learning.  Outside of software, I'm also interested in architecture, cars, photography, urban design, and public transit.

## Contact

I can be reached by [email](mailto:ivor.benderavage@gmail.com), or by [LinkedIn message](https://linkedin.com/in/ibenderavage).
