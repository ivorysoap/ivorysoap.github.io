Back in January when travel was still possible, I had the opportunity to attend the 2020 [IEEE Rising Stars conference](https://ieee-risingstars.org/) in Las Vegas.  

Rising Stars is organized by a small group of IEEE members closely associated with [IEEE Young Professionals](https://yp.ieee.org/ieee-rising-stars-conference-2020/), one of their largest sponsors.   Unlike other tech conferences, Rising Stars doesn't have a particular theme year-to-year, which I liked; it's just student-oriented conference that aims to help future engineering grads to network and to gain insights on the industry and possible career paths.

This was my first trip to Vegas (really, it was my first trip anywhere west of Ontario), so it was an exciting time for me.   By a weird coincidence, on the second flight there we ended up sitting with two of the conference organizers, Anis and Zied, so we got a bit of a preview of the conference from them, which was nice.  The conference kicked off on January 3rd, the morning after we landed.

Most of the conference consisted of talks and workshops with invited guests, with breaks for networking in between.  First, we heard from the founder of quantum computing company [Strangeworks](http://strangeworks.com).  Some of the other events included a talk from LinkedIn on their system and network architecture, a series of workshops on the various IEEE humanitarian initiatives (like [IEEE SIGHT](https://sight.ieee.org/) and [EPICS](https://epics.ieee.org/)), and a talk on emerging technologies by a senior engineer at Qualcomm.   There were a few that I found particularly interesting, like the one on autonomous vehicles given by the CTO of autonomous transportation startup [Locomation](https://locomation.ai/), a company that develops autonomous trucks; also, a really thorough cybersecurity talk by Ilene Klein, the cybersecurity program coordinator for the City of Phoenix.


On the whole, I definitely enjoyed attending Rising Stars, and I would recommend it to anyone who is graduating in an EECS field soon.  There were a few downsides, like the fact that many of the organizations were based in the US (like IEEE USA, IEEE GRSS, etc.), and have a limited impact to graduates from Canada who want to get involved with them or work for them.  Despite that, I would still say it was a fun and well-organized conference, and it definitely opened my eyes to the benefits offered by [IEEE Young Professionals](https://yp.ieee.org/) to new grads.  Congrats to the organizers on a job well done!

As a final note: if you're a student who wants to attend this conference (or really any other IEEE conference), get involved with or talk to your school's IEEE student branch.  The high price of tickets to these conferences makes it difficult for many students to attend them, but it's really common for the tickets to be subsidized by IEEE student branches, local chapters, or university faculties — which is actually how we were able to attend RS at a much lower cost than if we'd paid for the whole trip ourselves.
